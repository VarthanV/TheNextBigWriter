Creating REST API Using NodeJS, ExpressJs, MongoDB, And Mongoose

Hello Everyone 

My Name is  Minhaj Ahmad Khan and I'm a Front-End developer. This is my first blog where I create a REST API using NodeJS, ExpressJs, MongoDB, and Mongoose. I'm super excited so let's get started.


 A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architecture. REST stands for representational state transfer. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are everywhere. It is a software that allows two applications to communicate with each other over the internet and through various devices. Every time you access an app like Instagram or check the weather on your smartphone, an API is used. 


##  Prerequisite 


-  Node

-  MongoDB

-  Create a repository

- Express

- Mongoose

- Nodemon

- Postman










  ### Install Node

  If you have already  Node on your machine then skip this step. [Know How To Download & Install Node.js](https://www.edureka.co/blog/node-js-installation/) 

  ### Install MongoDB 

   if you have already  MongoDB  on your machine then skip this step.  [Know How To Download & Install MongoDB](https://www.edureka.co/blog/install-mongodb-on-windows/) 



  ### Install Express

Express is a fast, assertive, essential, and moderate web framework of Node.js that helps manage a server and routes.

Let's install Express by running this command on the shell. 
```
npm install express
```




### Install Mongoose 

Mongoose is a way to make a connection with the MongoDB database. It provides MongoDB validation and query in a very simple manner and it makes development fast.

Let's install Mongoose with Node by running this  command on shell 
```
npm install mongoose
```




### Install Nodemon 

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node. js based applications by automatically
restarting the Node application when file changes in the directory are detected.



Let's install Nodemon by running this command on shell
 ```
npm install Nodemon
```





### Postman

 Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by 
 others or test ones you have made yourself. [Know How To Download & Install Postman
](https://www.softwaretestingmaterial.com/install-postman/) 

We now have everything needed to start building our  API.

## Let's Code

We are going to create a RESTFUL API that maintains student records. We will perform Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operation. These are the following steps 


1. Create Repository 

2. At Boilerplate

3. Connect to MongoDB

4. Define Schema

5. Write CRUD Operation


  ### 1. Create a repository

  Let's create a repository called **RestfulAPI** 

  Open **RestfulAPI** repository on shell
  
`npm init -y` initializing our project 

 Now we can see the **package.json** file which will include all the packages we 
 need.

### 2. Add Boilerplate

Let's write some javascript that will initialize and define endpoints in app.js
avoid **get()** we discuss after a while.




```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 ;

app.get('/', (req,res)=>{

      res.send('<h1>this is home page of Student Api </h1>')
})

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log(`connection is  extablished`)
});
```
Require express now we got express as a function and create new constant with the help of express for use express method and properties.

listen() method creates a listener on the specified port or path.




Let's run this code  ``` nodemon src/app.js``` and see what happens

 Cool!  the connection is established let's move forward  

### 3. Connect to MongoDB

Let's connect MongoDB with mongoose
for that, we need to create a folder and file inside src folder ```src/database/connection.js ``` where write some javascript code to connect to MongoDB to the mongoose.

```
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
let url = process.env.DATABASE_URL || "mongodb://localhost:27017/students-record";
mongoose.connect(url, {
    useCreateIndex: true,
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true
}).then(() => {
    console.log('connection successful')
}).catch((e) => {
    console.log(`connection unsuccessful ${e}`)
})
```

As we can see in the above code block we are using `mongoose.connect()` method to connect to MongoDB database.

We need this to connect the student record database running locally on the default port (27017).
 
Then we need to call the connect function with the help of mongoose where we pass URL and a call back function that returns a promise. To avoid
deprecation Warnings set ```useCreateIndex: true,
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true```
 

We need to require **connection.js** in our express file **(app.js) **   ```require('./database/connection')```

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 ;

require('./database/connection')

app.post('/studentregistration', (req,res)=>{

      res.send('<h1>this is home page of Student Api </h1>')
})

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log(`connection is  extablished`)
});
```

Now run ** app.js** file and see what happens 



![Screenshot (765).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607606304478/TJXDTRO0j.png)

Cool! database connection was successful 

 ### 4. Defining Schema


Now let's define our database schema for that we need to create a folder and file inside src  **src/model/student-schema.js**. To know more about schema read  [official document here ](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#definition) 

```

const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const student-schema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        minlength: 3,
    },
   class : {
      type:String,
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,

    },
    phone: {
        type: Number,
        required: true,
        maxlength: 10,
        minlength: 10
    },
    address: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
    }
})

const student = new mongoose.model('student', student-schema)

module.exports = student;

``` 

After defining schema we defined collection(table) with the help of a ```mongoose.model``` method and pass collection name ```student``` and schema name ```student-schema``` then exports this collection because we need to use in **app.js** file.



```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 ;
const student = require('./model/studentschema')
require('./database/connection')


app.post('/studentregistration', (req,res)=>{

      res.send('<h1>this is home page of Student Api </h1>')
})

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log(`connection is  extablished`)
});
``` 
Cool! database connected. The defined schema is working correctly now let's move on to the second part of the blog which is create, read, update, delete  (CRUD) operation. 
 

## CRUD Operation 

 

###  Create Data

The `POST` method sends data to the server.  [Know more about POST method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) 
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 ;
const student = require('./model/studentschema')
app.use(express.json())
require('./database/connection')

app.post('/student-registration', (req, res) => {
    const user = new student(req.body)
    user.save().then(() => {
        res.status(201).send(user)
    }).catch((e) => {
        res.status(500).send(e)
    })
})

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log(`connection is  extablished`)
});


```

This method will accept **name, class, email, phone, address** from the ```req.body```

POST method takes two parameters so we passed **root** and  **callback function**.
The callback function has two parameters req and res. By using ```req.body```  we are fetching data from the body and store in our collection(table) by ```save()```.

**Let's test our post API using postman 
**




![post.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607765551193/g5xsdueP4.png)

Wow, it's working fine data successful store in our collection.

###  Read Data

This method will return All Student records.  [Know more about GET method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) 

Now letâ€™s  create a router with our first GET method:

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000 ;
const student = require('./model/studentschema')
app.use(express.json())
require('./database/connection')

app.get('/show-student-record', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const showStudentData = await student.find()
        res.status(200).send(showStudentData)
    } catch (e) {
        res.status(500).send(e)
    }
})

app.listen(port , ()=>{
    console.log(`connection is  extablished`)
});

```
```.find()``` return all the student records from student. If the student record cannot be found, the method returns the error message and status code 500.

 ** Let's test our post API using postman **



![get.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607765995286/Veq0OISv7.png)

It's working perfectly fine we can see all records in our database 



### Update Data

PATCH method can be used to update partial resources. For instance, We need to update one field of the resource hence we are using the **PATCH** method.  [Know more about PATCH method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH) 

```
app.patch('/student-record-update/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const _id = req.params.id;
        const studentUpdate = await student.findByIdAndUpdate(_id, req.body, {
            new: true
        })
        res.status(200).send(studentUpdate)
    } catch (e) {
        res.status(500).send(e)
    }
})
```

Functions need an  `ObjectID` to be able to tell the database which specific document you want to update. `ObjectID` created automatically when we insert a new record into your database after that we are adding an `ObjectID` in the URL then we require `ObjectID` from a URL  like this   ```   const _id =req.params.id;```.
After that  ```findByIdAndUpdate()```  where the first argument is an ```_id ``` and a second argument is an Object that will update the data.

** Let's test our  API  using the PostMan **

Before updating student record

After updating student record



![after update.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1607770706984/IJU9rgg9r.png)


###  Delete Data

The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.  [Know more about DELETE method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE) 

```
app.delete('/student-record-delete/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const _id = req.params.id
        const deleteRecord = await student.findByIdAndDelete(_id)
        res.status(200).send(deleteRecord)
    } catch (e) {
        res.status(500).send(e)
    }
})
```
Functions need an ObjectID to be able to tell the database which specific document you want to delete. It's very similar to a patch request instead of ```findByIdAndUpdate``` we are using find ```findByIdAndDelete``` where we are passing _id in both arguments like this ```findByIdAndDelete({_id:_id})``` we know that key and value are same so we write like this ```findByIdAndDelete(_id)```.

**Let's test our API  **

Before deleting  student record
